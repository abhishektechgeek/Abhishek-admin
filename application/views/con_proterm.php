                  <u>DISCLAIMERS.</u>
                  OTHER THAN SET FORTH HEREIN, FAVO MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
                  TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OR THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WITH RESPECT TO THE FAVO SITE,
                  ANY PRODUCTS, SERVICES OR INFORMATION PROVIDED THROUGH THE FAVO SITE, OR THE ACCURACY OF, OR RESULTS TO BE OBTAINED BY USING, THE FAVO
                  SITE. Favo is not involved in any actual transactions between Users and You through the RFI Program. Thus, Favo has no control over the
                  interest or ability of Users to purchase items or pay for services or the suitability of any User for Your products or services. Favo
                  cannot and does not control whether or not Users will complete the purchase of products or services for which they have requested
                  information. Because user authentication on the Internet is difficult, Favo cannot and does not guarantee that each User is who he or she
                  professes or claims to be. You assume all risk when using the Site, including but not limited to all of the risks associated with any
                  online or offline interactions with Users of the Site, and Favo disclaims any liability arising out of or in any way connected with such
                  interactions.

                  Ratings and reviews posted on the Site are the opinions of their respective authors. Such authors are solely responsible for such content.
                  Favo does not adopt, endorse or accept responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of any opinion, advice, or statement made by any
                  party that appears on the Site or through the Service. Under no circumstances will Favo or its affiliates be responsible for any loss or

                  You understand and agree that Favo may review and delete any Content, in each case in whole or in part, that in the sole judgment of Favo
                  violates this Agreement or which might be offensive, illegal, or that might violate the rights, harm, or threaten the safety of users of
                  the Site. We reserve the right to remove, screen, edit, or reinstate ratings and reviews from time to time at our sole discretion and
                  without notice to you. You may encourage others to write reviews about your business. However, you agree not to, and will not assist or
                  enable others to write a fraudulent or defamatory review, trade reviews with other businesses, compensate anyone to write a review on your
                  behalf, or write a review that you were paid for either directly or indirectly by the business being reviewed. You do have the right to
                  rebut a review by posting a response to a current review of your business, if such review originated on Favo.

                  <strong>11. Miscellaneous</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                  Favo does not approve of, or endorse, any product or service by electronically publishing the Listing. Favo may publish entries or listings
                  for any other party at any time. You and Favo are independent contractors, and no agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or
                  franchisor-franchisee relationship is intended or created by this Agreement. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of Delaware
                  without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any claims or legal actions by one party against the other shall be commenced and
                  maintained exclusively in any state or federal court located in Delaware, and both parties hereby submit to the jurisdiction and venue of
                  any such court and agree not to bring any claim or legal action in any other jurisdiction or venue. The language used in this Agreement
                  shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent. No principle of construction or rule of law that
                  provides that an agreement be construed against the drafter of the agreement in the event of any inconsistency or ambiguity in such
                  agreement shall apply to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any term or
                  provision of this Agreement shall in no way affect the validity, legality or enforceability of any other term or provision of this
                  Agreement. In the event a term or provision is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or
                  provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or
                  unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. No waiver of any default in performance of this
                  Agreement by either party, or waiver of any breach or a series of breaches of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement
                  shall constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or a waiver of such terms, covenants or conditions. Neither party may assign, sell,
                  transfer, delegate or otherwise dispose of this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the
                  other party, except that either party may assign this Agreement to any affiliate or any successor entity in a merger, consolidation,
                  business combination or sale of all or substantially all of its assets. Any purported assignment, transfer, or delegation in violation
                  hereof will be null and void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
                  and their respective permitted successors and assigns. Headings herein are for convenience of reference only and shall not be considered in
                  any interpretation of this Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Favo and You, and supersedes any prior verbal
                  or written agreements regarding the subject matter hereof.
