<p>
    If you are a consumer, you may use your account only to find Service Providers for yourself, your tenants (subject to existing contracts and/or
    agreements), your parents, your children, your grandchildren or individuals for whom you are otherwise the legal guardian. If you are a Service Provider,

</p>
<h3>
    3.3. Teen Providers, Parent Registered Users, and Parent Monitored Accounts
</h3>
<p>
    If you are fourteen (14) to seventeen (17) years of age and would like to participate in Favo as a Service Provider (a "Teen Provider"), you may register
    to use the Site and Services but only if your parent or legal guardian consents to your registration through the Favo site and also becomes a registered
    user (a "Parent Registered User"). Parent Registered Users will receive a copy of all communications between the Teen Provider and other Registered Users
    as well as a copy of all emails Favo sends to the Teen Provider. Parent Registered Users may respond to communications sent by other Registered Users to
    the Teen Provider and may report inappropriate message content to Favo. Parent Registered Users may also log in to, update the settings of and terminate
    their Teen Provider's account.
</p>
<p>
    For purposes of these Terms, Parent Registered Users and their Teen Provider are deemed to be Service Providers. By registering as a Parent Registered
    User, you hereby represent, warrant, understand, agree to and accept these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms in their entirety on behalf of
    yourself and your Teen Provider whether or not you use the Site or Services, including without limitation Favo's right to run the verification and
    background checks described in Section 4 below. You further understand and agree that you will ensure your Teen Provider's compliance with these Terms and

    Provider's activities both on and off of the Site, including monitoring who your Teen Provider communicates with and meets both on and off the Site and
    with whom he or she agrees to provide service provider services.
</p>
<p>
    If you register to use the Site as a Teen Provider, the first time you try to log in to your account after you turn eighteen (18), you will be required to
    agree to the Terms as in effect at the time, including the consents to run the verification and background checks described in Section 4 below. Once you
    accept the terms and log in, the parent monitoring functionality of your account will be removed and your Parent Registered User will no longer have access
    to your account. If you do not agree to the Terms after you turn eighteen (18), Favo may terminate your access to all or part of the Favo Site, remove your
    profile and/or any Content posted by or about you from the Site, and/or terminate your registration in Favo, with or without notice.

    by a consumer who is considering hiring them. Premier background checks are ordered by Employee Seekers subject to the written authorization of the Service
    Provider who is the subject of the check. Preliminary background checks are free when requested by a Consumer or Service Provider who is a paid subscriber.
    The other Background Check services require payment of a separate fee by the Member who is initiating the background check request.
</p>
<p>
    Each of these Background Check services are regulated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the "FCRA"), and the background reports resulting from these
    services are considered "consumer reports" under the FCRA. Consumer reports may contain information on your character, general reputation, personal
    characteristics, and mode of living, including but not limited to consumer credit, criminal history, workers' compensation, driving, employment, military,
    civil, and educational data and reports.
</p>
<p>
    Favo will receive a copy of each Background Check you order or authorize through Favo. See Section 4.3 below for information regarding Favo's use of these
    Background Checks. If you order a preliminary, preferred or preferred + Background Check about yourself, you will be emailed a copy of the results if it
    does not come back clean. You are responsible for making sure that the email addresses you provide to Favo is correct, knowing that sensitive information
    will be sent to it.
</p>
<p>
    If you order a preliminary, preferred or preferred + Background Check in response to a request by a Consumer who is considering hiring you and the check
    comes back clean or with information that does not result in Favo suspending or terminating your account, we will forward the check to the Consumer who
    requested it in accordance with your authorization at the time you ordered the check.
    <strong>
        The results of any preliminary, preferred or preferred + Background Check you order that results in Favo suspending or terminating your account will
        not be shared with other users.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    If a User orders a premier background check pursuant to your written authorization, the consumer reporting agency that performed the check will provide it
    directly to the User who ordered it based on your authorization that the User obtains the check.
    <strong>
        The results of a premier background check ordered by a User pursuant to your electronic authorization will be shared directly with the User regardless
        of its contents.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    If you have ordered a Background Check through Favo, we may indicate in your profile that you have completed that check. However, we will not share the
    results with any other site visitor or Registered User without your specific consent.
</p>
<h3>
    4.2. Special Responsibilities of Employee Seekers under FCRA
</h3>
<p>
    Employee Seekers may request and receive a copy of a Background Check on a Service Provider, subject to the Service Provider's explicit instructions about
    who may have access to such a report.
</p>
<p>
    If you receive a copy of a background report, you warrant that you will use such information only for a purpose permitted by FCRA, such as an employment
    purpose, and that you will comply with any and all applicable obligations of the FCRA as well as all other applicable consumer reporting laws.
</p>
<p>
Your responsibilities in using the information contained the background check can be found at    <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/fcrajump.shtm" target="_blank">http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/fcrajump.shtm</a>. FCRA governs the use of reports
    obtained from a consumer reporting agency, such as the third party consumer reporting agencies we use.
</p>
<p>
    If there is negative data in a check you receive, and you choose to take "adverse action" (i.e. choose to pass on that individual's candidacy) on the basis
of this negative data, you must agree to take certain procedural steps, which can be found at    <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/fcrajump.shtm" target="_blank">http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/fcrajump.shtm</a>. These include notifying the
    individual who is the subject of the report of your decision to take adverse action based on information contained in the report and the subject's right to
    contest the accuracy or completeness of the report. Moreover, if the subject contests the report with the consumer reporting agency, you are required to
    suspend the hiring process while the agency researches the accuracy and completeness of the report.
</p>

        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    If Favo terminates your membership or access to the Site on the basis of information in a Background Check, we will notify you and provide you the name and
    contact information of the consumer reporting agency that created the report. We will also provide you a copy of the report unless the consumer reporting
    agency has already provided you a copy or access to it. You hereby represent, understand and expressly agree that Favo does not have control over or assume
    any responsibility for the quality, accuracy, or reliability of the information included in these Background Checks. Furthermore, any inaccuracies in the

<h3>
    4.4 Favo May Order and Use Background Checks About You
</h3>
<p>
    By using the Site or Services as a User, Consumer or Service Provider, you hereby acknowledge and agree that Favo has the right, but not the obligation, to
    use a third party consumer reporting agency on an ongoing basis to use your personal information to run periodic background checks on you for the
    legitimate business purpose of protecting the safety and integrity of our Site and its users ("Internal Background Checks"). Favo may order these checks
    when you register with Favo and thereafter in connection with your continued use of our Services and/or interaction with our Site (such as by contacting or
    communicating with other members, posting or updating a job or profile, ordering or authorizing a Background Check, etc.).
</p>
<p>
    These Internal Background Checks are also regulated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the "FCRA"), and the background reports resulting from these services
    are considered "consumer reports" under the FCRA. Consumer reports may contain information on your character, general reputation, personal characteristics,
    and mode of living, including but not limited to consumer credit, criminal history, workers' compensation, driving, employment, military, civil, and
    educational data and reports.
</p>
<p>
    You understand and agree that Favo may review the information provided by the third party consumer reporting agency and that Favo retains the right to
    terminate your Favo registration based on the information it receives from these checks, even if such information was subsequently dismissed. If Favo
    terminates your membership or access to the Site on the basis of information in a background report, we will notify you and provide you the name and
    contact information of the consumer reporting agency that created the report. We will also provide you a copy of the report unless the consumer reporting
    agency has already provided you a copy or access to it. You hereby represent, understand and expressly agree that Favo does not have control over or assume
    any responsibility for the quality, accuracy, or reliability of the information included in these checks. Furthermore, any inaccuracies in the report must

    4.5. Favo May Regularly Verify Your Identity and the Accuracy of Your Representations and Warranties
</h3>
<p>
    By registering as a User, you authorize Favo, and acknowledge that for purposes of promoting the safety and integrity of its Site and Service, Favo
    reserves the right, but not the obligation, to utilize third party service providers to verify on an ongoing basis that your registration data is accurate
    and that the representations and warranties in Section 2.2 above addressing legal matters such as complaints, arrests, sex offender status, etc. are also
    true ("Verification Checks"). These third parties may use data from a variety of sources, under a variety of circumstances, for these site safety purposes
    including, without limitation, information from national criminal databases, sex offender registries, certain media streams, terrorist watch lists,
    criminal and fugitive watch lists, fraud watch lists, law enforcement reports, and other data.
</p>
<p>
    You agree that Favo may take such action in response to Verification Checks as it deems appropriate in its sole discretion, including without limitation
    suspending and/or terminating your membership, should it determine that you have violated any representation or warranty or any other provision of these
    Terms or are otherwise unsuitable for Favo.
</p>
<p>
    You also hereby represent, understand and expressly agree that Favo does not have control over or assume any responsibility for the quality, accuracy, or

    4.6 Release of Liability for Results of Background Checks, Internal Background Checks, and Verification Checks
</h3>
<p>
    If you decide to use or access information included in a Background Check, you hereby represent, understand and expressly agree that those checks are not
    always accurate or complete (or based on information that is accurate or complete) and that the specific records searched, and the comprehensiveness of the
    search, varies by the type of Background Check ordered as well as the state and county where the check is performed. For example, many jurisdictions only
    include felony conviction records (and not, for example, misdemeanor or arrest records) in the national criminal data base, which is the only data source
    utilized for preliminary background checks other than the sexual offender registry. Moreover, some states include only registered sex offenders in that
    database.
</p>
<p>
    If you decide to access, use, or share information provided by a Background Check, you agree to do so in accordance with applicable law. You also agree to
    indemnify and hold harmless Favo from any loss, liability, damage, or costs that may result from such access, use, or sharing of this information
    regardless of the cause. Favo does not assume and expressly disclaims, and you hereby agree to release Favo from, any loss, liability, damage, or costs
    that may result from the use of information provided in a background report including, without limitation, the inaccuracy or incompleteness of any such
    information.

    You expressly acknowledge that Favo has no obligation to perform Background Checks, Internal Background Checks, or Verification Checks on any Registered

    9. Payment And Refund Policy
</h2>
<p>
    In order to utilize some Favo Services or product offerings, the Service Provider must pay Favo either a recurring subscription or one-time fee. Consumers
    are not charged for any fees in connection with using the Favo app, except for optional services (such as background checks). The consumer, unless
    otherwise agreed to with a Service Provider, is responsible for any state or local sales taxes associated with the Services or product offerings purchased.
</p>
<h3>
    8.1 Billing and Payment
</h3>
<p>
    If you sign up for a Favo, you agree to pay Favo all charges associated with a service plan you subscribe to as described at the time you subscribe and
    provide your payment information. You also authorize Favo to charge your chosen payment provider according to the terms of the plan to which you subscribe.
    The subscription period and the amount and frequency of the charges will vary depending on the subscription plan you select. Favo reserves the right to
    correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment.
</p>
<p>
    To the extent you elect to purchase other Services or product offerings we may offer for a fee, you authorize Favo to charge your chosen payment provider
    for the Services and/or products you purchase. You agree that if Favo already has your credit card on file as a result of prior purchases you have made, we
    may charge that credit card for the additional Services/products you purchase.
</p>
<h3>
    8.2 Automatic Subscription Renewal and Cancellation
</h3>
<p>
    Favo paid membership subscriptions will continue indefinitely until cancelled by the user. After your initial subscription commitment period, and again
    after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically renew for an additional equivalent period as the subscription term you
    originally selected and at the subscription rate and frequency disclosed to you on the Site when you originally subscribed, unless otherwise provided at
    the time you subscribed. If you sign up for a payment plan that allows you to be charged monthly over the subscription period and you decide to cancel your
    subscription during the subscription period, you acknowledge and agree that you will continue to be billed for the subscription on a monthly basis until
    its originally scheduled expiration date.
</p>
<p>
    You may cancel your paid membership subscription by adjusting your <a href="http://www.care.com/account-preferences-p1016.html">account settings</a>. If
    you cancel your subscription, you typically will be permitted to use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term. Your
    subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires, but your credit card will be charged, and you will be required to pay, any
    cancellation or other fees associated with your early termination and disclosed to you at the time you signed up for the subscription plan.
</p>
<h3>
    8.3 Refund Policy
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>
        <em>
            Except as set forth below, all payments for services/products are non-refundable and there are no refunds or credits for unused or partially used
            services/products or service/product cancellations.
        </em>
    </strong>
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have a paid membership subscription that is automatically renewed, we will refund the most recent charge to your
    credit card if (i) you cancel your subscription within thirty (30) days after the most recent charge, and (ii) you have not used your subscription during
    the current renewal period. The refund will apply to the most recent charge only. In addition, Favo reserves the right to immediately downgrade or cancel
    your membership after payment of your refund. Favo does not provide refunds or credits under any other circumstances, unless it determines in its sole
    discretion that a refund or credit is warranted due to extenuating circumstances, such as a duplicate account.
</p>
<h3>
    8.4 Free Trial Offers
</h3>
<p>
    Favo may offer limited-time free trial subscriptions to certain users from time-to-time. Users who sign up for a Favo Service on a free trial basis may
    have limited access to the Service and/or features of the Site. If a user signs up for a free trial subscription, after the expiration of the free trial
    period, the user will be charged the price then in effect for a subscription to the Service, unless otherwise provided to him or her when he or she
    originally subscribed. If a user does not want to continue with the Service after the expiration of the free trial period, the Consumer or Service Provider
    must cancel their subscription within thirty (30) days of being charged the subscription fee for the Service. Upon cancellation, the Consumer or Service
    Provider's credit card will be refunded for the amount of the most recent subscription charge so long as he or she has not used the subscription after the
    expiration of the free trial period.

    Service Providers may post profiles and submit proposals to Employee Seekers regarding their services. In some instances, we or our affiliates or partners,
    may provide Employee Seekers a customized list of potential individuals, companies and/or agencies to consider based on the information the Consumer
    provides us regarding their service request (either for themselves, their tenants, or anyone else) preferences. However, if a Consumer agrees on the
    provision of services from an individual, company or agency we identify through any of those Services, such agreement is solely between the Consumer and
    the Service Provider; neither Favo nor its affliliates or partners is a party to any such agreement. Providers has passed a vigorous screening process
    including background and reference checks. However, each such agency operates independently of Favo and is not under our control. Any issues concerning the
    conduct of a Consumer or Service Provider including, without limitation, the RFI created by the Consumer, reply to RFI from the Service Provider,
    scheduling, the services received by the Consumer or payment due to the Service Provider, must be resolved directly by the Consumer and the Service
    Provider. Favo will not be held responsible and expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever for any claims, demands or damages direct or indirect of every
    kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such issues. You
    further understand that any special promotions, guarantees, or any other offerings by Favo are voided if either the Provider or the Consumer have not
    completed the Transaction on Favo. It is the Users responsibility, individually, to ensure the other party completes his part of the Transaction (e.g., a
    Consumer must request an invoice is one is not provided and/or a Provider must request payment via the Site). By using this Site or our Services, you do
    hereby represent, understand, and expressly agree to hold Favo harmless for any claim or controversy that may arise from any disputes between you and any
    Consumer, Service Provider or other user(s) of the Site. You agree to take reasonable precautions in all interactions with Employee Seekers, Service
Providers or other users of the Site or the Services, particularly if you decide to meet offline. In addition, you agree to visit the Favo    <a href="http://www.care.com/safety-center-p1273.html">Safety Center</a> prior to using the Service. By using the Site or the Services, you do hereby agree

    14. Agreement to Arbitrate
</h2>
<h3>
    13.1 Agreement to Arbitrate
</h3>
<p>
    This Section 13 is referred to in these Terms as the "Arbitration Agreement". Unless you opt-out in accordance with the opt-out procedures set forth below,
    you agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Favo or a Favo Affiliate, whether relating to these Terms
(including any alleged breach thereof), the Services, the Site, or otherwise, shall be resolved exclusively through    <strong><em>final and binding arbitration, rather than a court</em></strong> in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except you may
assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Your rights will be determined by a    <strong><em>neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury</em></strong>. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this
    Arbitration Agreement.
</p>
<h3>
    13.2 Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>
        <em>
            YOU AND FAVO AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
            PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND FAVO AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE
            THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE
            ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY
            TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER FAVO USERS.
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<h3>
    13.3 Pre- Arbitration Dispute Resolution
</h3>
<p>
    Favo is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently. So before you commence arbitration, we suggest that you contact us to explain
your complaint, as we may be able to resolve it without the need for arbitration. You may contact us via email at    <a href="mailto:careteam@care.com">careteam@Favo</a> or at Favo, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 201 Jones Road, Suite 500, Waltham, MA 02451.
</p>
<h3>
    13.4 Arbitration Procedures
</h3>
<p>
    Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's ("AAA") rules and procedures, including the
    AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the "AAA Rules"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on
    the AAA, please visit its website, <a href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">http://www.adr.org</a>. Information about the AAA's Rules and fees for
consumer disputes can be found at the AAA's consumer arbitration page,    <a href="http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration" target="_blank">http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration</a>. If there is any inconsistency between the
    AAA Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the
    inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these
    Terms as a court would, including without limitation, the limitation of liability provisions in Section 11. Although arbitration proceedings are usually
    simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a
    court can award to an individual under the Terms and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court
    only for very limited reasons.
</p>
<p>
    To commence an arbitration against Favo, you must complete a short form, submit it to the AAA, and send a copy to Favo at Favo, Inc., Attn: Legal
Department, 201 Jones Road, Suite 500, Waltham, MA 02451. For more information, see the AAA's claim filing page,    <a href="http://www.adr.org/fileacase" target="_blank">http://www.adr.org/fileacase</a>. You may represent yourself in the arbitration or be represented by
    an attorney or another representative. Once we receive your arbitration claim, we may assert any counterclaims we may have against you.
</p>
<p>
    The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or
    less you or Favo may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you
    and Favo subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at any in-person hearing may be
    made by telephone by you and/or Favo, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.
</p>
<p>
    The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including recognized principles of
    equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different
    Favo users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Favo user to the extent required by applicable law.
</p>
<h3>
    13.5 Costs of Arbitration
</h3>
<p>
    Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the "Arbitration Fees") will be governed by the AAA's Rules, unless otherwise
    provided in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If you demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees
    or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Favo will pay your
    portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of
    litigation, Favo will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Each
    party will be responsible for all other fees it incurs in connection with the arbitration, including without limitation, all attorney fees. In the event
    the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse Favo for all fees associated with the
    arbitration paid by Favo on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.
</p>
<h3>
    13.6 Confidentiality
</h3>
<p>
    All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all
    parties.
</p>
<h3>
    13.7 Severability
</h3>
<p>
    If a court decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement other than Section 13.2 is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to
    replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or
    unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court decides that any of the provisions of
    Section 13.2 is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void. The remainder of the Terms will continue
    to apply.
</p>
<h3>
    13.8 Opt-Out Procedure
</h3>
<p>
    You can choose to reject this Arbitration Agreement by mailing us a written opt-out notice ("Opt-Out Notice") in accordance with the terms of this Section.
    For new Favo users, the Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than 30 Days after the date you accept these Terms for the first time or August 20,2013,
    whichever is later. If you are already a current Favo user and previously accepted the Favo Terms prior to the introduction of this Arbitration Agreement,
    the Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than August 20, 2013. You must mail the Opt-Out Notice to Favo, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 201 Jones
    Road, Suite 500, Waltham MA 02451. The Opt-Out Notice must state that you do not agree to the Arbitration Agreement and must include your name, address,
    phone number, and the email address(es) used to log in to the Favo account(s) to which the opt-out applies. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be
    effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, all other terms of
    these Terms will continue to apply. Opting out of the Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you
    may have with us.
</p>
<h3>
    13.9 Future Changes to this Arbitration Agreement
</h3>
<p>
    Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a
    change to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, that change shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding
    against Favo prior to the effective date of the change. Moreover, if we seek to terminate this Arbitration Agreement from these Terms, such termination
    shall not be effective until 30 days after the version of these Terms not containing the Arbitration Agreement is posted to the Site, and shall not be
    effective as to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Favo prior to the effective date of removal.
</p>
<h2>
    <a name="governingLaw"></a>
    15. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
</h2>
<p>
    These Terms, and any dispute between you and Favo, shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without regard to principles of
    conflicts of law, provided that the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of Section 13, the Arbitration Agreement.
    Unless you and we agree otherwise, in the event that the Arbitration Agreement 13 is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute (except
    for small-claims court actions), either as a result of your decision to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement or as a result of a decision by the arbitrator
    or a court order, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and Favo must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal
    court located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. You and Favo agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the Commonwealth
    of Massachusetts for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.
</p>
<h2>
    <a name="misc"></a>
    16. Miscellaneous
</h2>
<p>
    Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as making either party the partner, joint venturer, agent, legal representative, employer, contractor or
    employee of the other. Neither party shall have, or hold itself out to any third party as having any authority to make any statements, representations or
    commitments of any kind, or to take any action, that shall be binding on the other, except as provided for herein or authorized in writing by the party to
    be bound. The invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any term or provision of these Terms shall in no way effect the validity, legality or
    enforceability of any other term or provision of these Terms. In the event a term or provision is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties
    agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the
    invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and these Terms shall be enforceable as so modified. Each Affiliate (as defined in Section 1.2) is expressly
    made a third party beneficiary of this Agreement and may enforce this Agreement directly against you. This Agreement will be binding on and will inure to
    the benefit of the legal representatives, successors and assigns of the parties hereto.
